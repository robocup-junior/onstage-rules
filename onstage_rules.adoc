These are the official rules for the RoboCupJunior OnStage events in 2024.

Major changes from the 2023 OnStage rules are written in [red]#red#.

*Teams should make sure to review _ALL_ the pages of these rules.* The rules have been changed to deepen
and broaden the educational benefits of competing in RoboCupJunior. It focuses on the evolving technologies
available in our time.

*The International Original Rules (in English) have priority over [.underline]#any# translations.*
These rules are the official rules of the RoboCup Federation.

*The rules, score sheets, and all forms of documentation can be downloaded from the official
RoboCupJunior website* (https://junior.robocup.org). Each team has a responsibility to verify the latest
version of these documents prior to the competition, as changes may be made at any moment. Teams are
encouraged to study all documents in detail.

[discrete]
== RoboCupJunior Forum

For inquiries and questions about the rules or competition updates, the *Official RoboCupJunior forum*
(https://junior.forum.robocup.org/) can be used to contact the OnStage League Committee. All official
communication from the committee will be published here before and during the competition season.

== RoboCupJunior OnStage YouTube channel

Examples of good performances and documentation can be found on the *Official RoboCupJunior OnStage
YouTube channel* (https://www.youtube.com/@rcjonstage).

[discrete]
== Overview

RoboCupJunior OnStage invites teams to design, build and program creative and autonomous
physical robots. The objective is to create either a live or streamed, robotic performance that uses a
wide variety of technology to engage an audience. This includes a range of possible performances,
such as dance, storytelling, theater, or art installations. The performance may involve music, but this
is optional. The league is intended to be open-ended. Teams are encouraged to be creative,
innovative, and entertaining, in both the design of the robots and in the design of the overall
performance.

An OnStage performance should make use of innovative technologies or use technology in new
innovative ways not previously developed in OnStage performances, while adding value to the
performance. Innovation can be achieved with clear evidence of testing, research and development
and can be an inspiration for future competitors.

An OnStage Performance must showcase the implementation and integration of robotic features in
ways that visually enhance or add value and contribute to the theme or story being portrayed.
{++More information about the selection of the features can be found in section <<judging-overview>>.++}

During the International RoboCupJunior OnStage Competition, teams also take part in a SuperTeam
Challenge. The SuperTeam Challenge is a robotic performance created by a group of two or more
cooperating teams from different regions. The SuperTeams spend a short period of time for the
collaborative performance creation. More details will be released before the International
RoboCupJunior competition {--on the official website--}.

From 2021 onwards, there will be no sub-leagues in RoboCupJunior OnStage.

[[judging-overview]]
== Judging Overview

All teams are judged in the following areas: a Technical Description Poster,
Technical Demonstration Video, Technical Interview, and an OnStage Performance.
Teams must highlight four of their robot(s) features in the work they present to
the judges. Ask the following question - “What do we believe are our best
system/sensor integration, electromechanical design, interaction, or software
solutions implemented on their robot(s)?” The aim should be to present how the
chosen features are integrated to enhance the quality of the performance in
unique and innovative ways. Examples of features include, but are not limited to: 

- Locomotion
- Object/human detection and avoidance
- Human, robot and/or prop interaction
- Manipulation (grabbing/grasping)
- Visual/audio recognition
- Localization and mapping

Teams should describe and provide reasoning for their four chosen features in the
Technical Description Poster and during their Technical Demonstration Video, before
being judged on the implementation of these features during the Performance. In
addition, teams should demonstrate their understanding of their systems in the
Technical Interview.

For clarification on a teams’ features, please do not hesitate to reach out to
the OnStage League committee using the RoboCupJunior Forum.

[[general]]
== General

It is the responsibility of the participating team(s) and regional representatives
to verify the participants' eligibility requirements, which are as follows:

[[team-size-membership]]
=== Team Size & Membership

Each team must have *2 to 5 members*. Each team member needs to carry a technical
role within the team, such as Electrical, Mechanical, Software etc. Each
participant can join only one team. No members can be shared between teams
and/or leagues.

[[age-requirement]]
=== Age requirement

All team members must be aged 14 to 19 years old (ages as of 1st of July).

[[general-robocupjunior-rules]]
All RoboCupJunior OnStage Teams must also comply with the RoboCupJunior General
Rules which can be found at:
https://junior.robocup.org/robocupjunior-general-rules/

[[onstage-performance]]
== OnStage Performance (40% of total score)

The OnStage Performance is an opportunity to demonstrate the design,
construction, and technical aspects of the robot(s) through a performance
or stage show. For example, this could be a magic show, theater performance,
story, comedy show, dance, or art installation. Teams are encouraged to be
creative, innovative and take risks in their use of technology and materials
when creating their performances. 

Teams will present a live performance, in which their routine will be judged.
Teams will present and demonstrate the four features to be judged, and higher
marks will be awarded for the integration of these features and the value that
they add to the performance. For more details on this, refer to the OnStage
Performance Score Sheet. Teams must show originality, creativity and innovation
throughout their performance routine. It is expected that all participating
teams perform their best.

[[judging]]
=== Judging

Teams have up to two opportunities to perform before the judges. If more
than one performance is scheduled, the highest score from each performance
will be used. The top-scoring teams may be invited to perform again in a
final competition.

The stage performance will be judged by a panel of at least three
officials. At least one of these judges is a RoboCupJunior official who
has judged the Technical Interview as well.
 
[[stage-performance]]
=== Stage performance

{++Teams have up to two opportunities to perform before the judges.++}

The duration of the performance routine must be no less than 1:30 minutes.

Each team has a total of seven minutes on the stage. This time includes
stage set-up, introduction, and performance routine, including any re-starts
due to factors under the team’s control, and the time for packing up and
clearing the stage. The timer only stops when the entire stage is clear with
no remnants from the previous performance.

When a team is asked to come onto the stage, a RoboCupJunior official
starts the timer.

If the time limit is exceeded due to circumstances outside the team’s
control (for example problems with starting the music) there will be no
penalty. The judges have the final say on any time penalties.

[blue-background]#Teams wait on the side of the stage before being
welcomed on stage. A technician designated by RoboCupJunior officials will
start the music and the audiovisual / multimedia presentation for the
performance routine.# 

[green-background]#Teams are required to join the “Backstage Pit” of an
online platform, which will allow them to test their AV and streaming
connections. Teams will then be moved to the main performance “stage” for
the commencement of their live performance. Teams start the music for the
performance routine once on the “stage”.#

Performances will not be live-streamed for general public viewing.
Recordings will be edited and released onto the RoboCupJunior OnStage YouTube
channel. Teams have an option to request not to publish the recording of their
performance if they wish.

Teams are strongly encouraged to use the time while they are setting up on
the stage to introduce to the audience the performance and the features of
their robots.

Teams must indicate the start of their performance clearly with a “3-2-1"
countdown to the judges.

{++Teams must indicate the end of their performance clearly once it’s over (e.g. everyone coming to the front of
the stage / thanking the audience for their attention / …).++}

[[restarts]]
=== Restarts

Teams can restart their routine if necessary, at the discretion of the
judges. There is no limit on the number of restarts allowed within the
stage-time. Penalty marks will be deducted from the score.

The team must leave the stage after their time on stage has expired.

[[music-and-multimedia-presentations]]
=== Music and Multimedia presentations

Teams may use music or video to complement their performance. The music
should start at the beginning of the performance with a few seconds of
silent lead-time.

If a team uses copyrighted music, they should follow the Copyright Law of
the region where the event is held. 

Teams are encouraged to provide a visual or multimedia presentation as part
of their performance. This can take the form of a video, animation, slideshow,
etc. However, the content should be made by the team themselves.

Interaction between the robots and the visual display is allowed and
encouraged. 

[blue-background]#During on-site presentations, a projector and screen or
LED screen is provided. The organizers cannot guarantee the height above the
stage or the size of the screen.#

[blue-background]#A HDMI and 3.5 mm AUX cable is available on stage through
which a laptop or other device can be connected to the display device. The
length of the cable cannot be guaranteed.#

[blue-background]#If music is used, teams must provide their own audio
music source. The preferred transport method is to place the sound or video
file on a memory stick as an MP3/MP4 file. The memory stick should be clearly
labeled with the team's name and should hold only the required files. It is
essential that the music be given to a sound technician or a RoboCupJunior
official on the competition setup day. Teams are encouraged to bring multiple
copies of the audio source file.#

[green-background]#Teams may screen share their audio and video through their
computers but must inform the judges of their additional screen sharing
requirements before starting their performance. Teams are responsible for
starting their multimedia presentations from their shared computer but are
reminded that the robotic performance should be the main attraction.#

[[Stage]]
=== Stage

==== Virtual teams

[green-background]#The size of the performance stage area is up to the
discretion of the teams. The performance area must be visible in the camera's
field of view. However, the maximum size of the performance stage area is a
rectangular area of 5 x 4 meters (m) for robots with the 5 meter side facing
the judges.#

[green-background]#The judging camera, which shows the entire view of the
performing area must be set up as a static camera and should be placed in
approximately the position of the judge's table at an in-person competition.
See <<appendix-a>>.#

[green-background]#Teams can use a second camera to show details of their
robots during the performance. However, they should be aware that additional
views may detract from the overall performance. Judges must be informed
before the start of the performance where the additional camera(s) will be
placed so the correct screen can be pinned during the performance.#

==== On-Site teams

[blue-background]#The size of the performance stage area is a rectangular
area of 5 x 4 meters (m) for robots with the 5 meter side facing the judges.#

[blue-background]#There is a line marking the edge of the 5 x 4 meter
stage. See <<appendix-a>>.#

[blue-background]#The floor provided shall be made of a flat (non-glossy)
white surface, for example, painted MDF (compressed wood fiber). While floor
joints will be made to be as smooth as possible, robots must be prepared for
irregularities of up to 5 mm in the floor surface. Whilst every effort will
be made to make the stage flat, this may not be possible, and teams should be
prepared to cope with this uncertainty.#

[blue-background]#Teams should come prepared to calibrate their robots based
on the lighting conditions at the venue.#

[blue-background]#Teams using compass sensors should be aware that metal
components of the staging may affect the compass sensor readings. Teams should
come prepared to calibrate such sensors.#

[[robots]]
=== Robots

Robots must perform autonomously.

Laptops, notebooks, mobile phones, tablets, Raspberry Pi, and other similar
devices can be used as robotic controllers.

Teams should construct their own robot rather than using the instructions
that come with a commercial kit. Teams are encouraged to design their robot
appearance by themselves. If a team wants to use a famous character as their
robot, the team should pay attention to the copyright of the character.

A team may have and use any number of robots. Robots may be of any size.
However, using multiple robots does not necessarily result in obtaining higher
points. Large robots do not count for more.

[[communication-and-localization]]
=== Communication and Localization

Teams are encouraged to design their robots to interact with a communication
function. Robots are encouraged to communicate with each other during the
performance. Suggested and allowed communication protocols are infrared (IR),
Bluetooth (LE and classic), ZigBee, or other localization platforms.

There must be no communication between off-stage and on-stage devices. 

It is the team’s responsibility to make sure that their communication function
does not interfere with other teams' robots when practicing or performing. 

No team is permitted to use other radio frequency (RF) signals (like Wi-Fi
or Z waves) as this may interfere with robots in other RoboCup leagues. If you
are unsure, please check with the OnStage League Committee before your
performance.

[blue-background]#Teams should prepare for disruptions in communication
protocols and unavailability of Wifi (As outlined in the general rules) before
and during the setup and stage time.#

Any localization beacons or markers for a robot's localization system should
be placed within the confines of the stage.

[[scenery]]
=== Scenery

Interactive props can be used to add value to the performance.

{--Static props which do not form an integral part of the performance are
discouraged since the focus of the performance should be on robots.--} The kind
of props that are considered "interactive" are:
1. Props interact with robots via sensors
2. Props interact with robots via communication

Robots can sense static props to perform a certain task or trigger {~~a performance~>an action} provided that they are placed on the defined stage performance area.

{++Static props which do not form an integral part of the performance are discouraged since the focus of the
performance should be on robots.++}

[[robot-autonomy-and-interaction]]
=== Robot Autonomy and Interaction

Robots may be started manually by human contact, sensor interaction or with
remote control at the beginning of the performance.

During the performance, remote control of a robot is prohibited, including
pressing buttons (including keyboards or phone applications) or similar
interactions with touch-like sensors. Touch-like sensors are defined as passive
sensors that have a logical single function dependent on human actions.

Humans directly influencing sensors to trigger the progression of the
performance will not be rewarded highly.

Intelligent interaction should be used to dynamically alter the robot's
behavior. Robots that interact with their environment and respond accordingly
will be highly rewarded. Natural human-robot interaction using sensors
responding to human gestures, expressions, sound, or proximity is encouraged.

Interaction between robots is highly encouraged. Robots are allowed to
physically touch and can interact through sensors and wired/wireless
communication.

All robot interactions must be visible to the judges for the entire
performance. This includes the initial manual start of each robot.

Any clarifications regarding this ruling should be directed to the committee
before the competition to ensure the interaction is permitted.

[[humans-on-stage]]
=== Humans on stage

Human team members may perform with their robots on the stage during the
performance. If so, they should make sure not to hide important key components
of their robot counterpart(s) from the judges/audience.

In order to keep the focus on the robots, humans on stage should make sure
to follow basic acting guidelines (not blocking the view, not standing with
their backs to the audience) and be professional on stage.

[[deductions]]
=== Deductions

If a team exceeds the time limits, it will be penalized by the loss of
points (see performance score sheet).

All robot movements or interactions that happen outside the performance
area for on-site performances, or the judges’ field of view for virtual
performances will not be considered for the scoring, but will not lead to
deductions.

Teams are reminded that humans triggering the progress of the performance
via touch-based sensors will be considered remote-controlled interaction and
therefore will be considered an unplanned human interaction during the
performance.

Unless a problem is not the fault of a team, one or more restarts will
result in a single score deduction.

A team who is not punctual will be penalized. If the team repeats unpunctual
behavior, they risk disciplinary action.

[[preparations-for-the-stage-performance]]
=== Preprarations for the stage performance

It is the responsibility of the team to ensure that the music and
video/presentation is playing correctly before their first performance by
liaising with the RoboCupJunior OnStage officials.

[blue-background]#Depending on the configuration of the stage and the sound
system at the venue, it is possible that the human starting the robot will
not be able to see the RoboCupJunior OnStage official starting the audio
source; and vice versa. Teams should come prepared for these conditions.#

[green-background]#Teams are recommended to practice their performances on
camera or online before presenting their performances at a virtual event.
Teams will be informed of the conferencing platform before the competition
and should use the platform to check their audio and visual before presenting
on stage.#

[[practice-on-the-main-stage]]
=== Practice on the Main Stage

[blue-background]#The main performance stage is available for teams to
practice on. In fairness to all teams who may wish to practice, a booking
sheet is used to reserve the stage for a short practice time. Please be
respectful of the allocated time.#

[blue-background]#Every team who practices on the main stage is responsible
for cleaning it after use. The stage must be fully cleaned for the next team
willing to use it. The team who uses the main stage just before starting the
performance judging should clean up at least 10 minutes before the judging
starts.#

[[content]]
=== Content

Performances should not include violent, military, threatening, or criminal
elements. This includes inappropriate or offensive words (including music)
and/or images. 

Participants are asked to carefully consider the wording and messages
communicated in any aspect of their performance. What seems acceptable to one
group may be offensive to friends from a different country or culture. 

A team whose routine may be deemed inappropriate to any particular group
will be asked to change their performance before being allowed to continue in
the competition. Teams who wish to clarify their performance theme or
elements of their performance may contact the OnStage League Committee before
the competition. Failure to remove inappropriate content will result in
disciplinary action. 

[[saftety-and-power-considerations]]
=== Safety and Power Considerations

Under no circumstances can mains electricity be used during the
performance. Every robot should be equipped with some sort of battery
power, with a maximum of 15 volts. 

Lead-acid batteries are not considered appropriate unless the team has
gained permission from the OnStage League Committee before attending the
competition for a specific reason. Failure to declare batteries may result
in disciplinary actions, including deductions.

Teams should be aware of the proper handling of lithium batteries to
ensure safety.

In venues where lithium batteries are being transported or moved, safety
bags must be used. 

Teams should design their robot in consideration of safety. Relative to
the size and capabilities of the robots, teams should consider:
1. Power Management - Cabling, batteries, emergency stop capabilities
2. Electromechanical System Risks - Exposed pinch points, leaks, sharp
edges, tripping hazards, appropriate actuators

Participants should design their robot(s) to be a size that they can easily
carry by themselves. Robots should be of a weight that team members can carry
and lift onto the stage with ease.

Robots with flying capabilities, such as drones, that can fly at a height
of more than 0.5 m (50 cm) from the stage are not permitted due to safety
concerns. Flying robots/drones must be inside of a safety net. No free-flying
robots are allowed in the venue. Any team planning to use a flying robot must
consult with the OnStage League Committee prior to coming to the competition.

To protect participants and comply with occupational health and safety
regulations, routines may not include projectiles, explosions, smoke, or flame,
use of water, or any other hazardous substances.

A team whose routine includes any situation that could be deemed hazardous,
including the possibility of damaging the stage, must submit a report
outlining the content of their performance to the Committee two weeks before
the competition. The Committee may also request further explanation and a
demonstration of the activity before the stage performance. Teams not
conforming to this rule may not be allowed to present their routine.

[[authenticity-and-originality]]
=== Authenticity and originality

Teams who, in the opinion of the judges, have knowingly produced duplicate
robots, costumes, or performance movements (duplicate music is allowed) of
another team will be subject to penalties. This applies to any previous
RoboCupJunior Dance or OnStage performance. In case of doubts, the team must
be able to provide clear documentation of their preparations and how they have
come to their idea.

Teams should inform the judges if some of their robotic components have
featured in a previous international performance in their Technical
Demonstration Video and the Technical Interview. To gain marks, teams should
be prepared to provide insight on how substantial changes have been made
between competitions, as evidence of the students’ continuing development
of the technologies.

[[onstage-technical-interview]]
== OnStage Technical Interview (30% of total score)

The Technical Interview is a live interview between the team and the judges,
in which all robots and programming are judged against technical criteria.
Creative and innovative technical features chosen by the team will be rewarded
with higher scores. Judges are interested in determining students'
understanding of the robotic technologies they have used.
Teams must show authenticity and originality regarding their robots and
performance in this interview.

Teams should inform the judges if robotic components have been featured in
previous competitions. To gain marks, teams should be prepared to provide
insight on how substantial changes have been made between competitions as
evidence of the students’ continuing development of the technologies.
Teams should specify how innovations have been done with their technologies
and provide documentation to support their claims.

[[interview-procedure]]
=== Interview procedure

All teams will have up to 20 minutes of technical interview judging
during the competition. This can either be [green-background]#a private live
video call with the judges# or [blue-background]#an in-person meeting with
the judges in a separate room at the venue.#

Interviews will be judged by at least two RoboCupJunior officials.

The Interview Score Sheet is used in the interview judging. It is strongly
suggested for teams to read the Technical Interview Score Sheet before the
interview to make effective use of the interview.

Teams should have all physical robotic systems present at the interview with
copies of all their work in a format that can be easily viewed. This includes
any programs, CAD/CAM designs, PCB designs, or wiring diagrams.

[green-background]#Teams should expect to screen share their work to the
judges.#

Each team member must be prepared to answer questions about the technical
aspects of their involvement in the robot design, construction, and
programming.

[[translator]]
=== Translator

The Technical Interviews take place in English. If teams require a
translator, they should inform the RoboCupJunior OnStage officials prior
to the event to allow translators to be organized.

Extra time will not be given for teams with a translator.

[[second-technical-interview]]
=== Second technical interview

If the judges consider it necessary, teams may be asked to complete
a second technical interview.

[[onstage-technical-documentation]]
== OnStage Technical Documentation (30% of total score)

[[technical-demonstration-video]]
=== Tecnical Demonstration Video (15% of total score)

Teams are required to submit a recorded demonstration to showcase the
capabilities of their robots. The aim of the technical demonstration is to
showcase how well the team integrated their robotics creations into a
perfect performance. They should demonstrate and describe the capabilities
of their robots such as interaction with humans or with each other using
mechanisms, sensor systems, and algorithms that have been developed
by the team.

The maximum length of the video is 5 minutes. If it is longer than 5 minutes,
it will be cut to that time for judging.

Robots should be presented without their costumes and key features of the
technologies used should be visible to the audience.

The team should explain how the capabilities have been developed, the
challenges overcome, and the technologies integrated. Teams should also
provide examples of solutions to any problems/issues during their
project development.

Teams will also be required to outline what they believe are their chosen
four features that they wish to be scored on during their OnStage
performance (See <<Overview>>).

Video editing is allowed and should be used to create a technically
engaging and informative demonstration of all robots. Teams may wish to
include full English subtitles or transcripts.

All team members are encouraged to be actively involved in the presentation.

The Technical Demonstration is assessed according to the Technical
Demonstration Score Sheet.

The demonstration needs to be recorded and the video file must be uploaded
by the deadline set by the OnStage League Committee.

[[technical-description-poster]]
=== Technical Description Poster (15% of otal score)

Each team is required to submit a Technical Description Poster by the deadline
set by the OnStage League Committee, which is before the first performance
during the RoboCupJunior competition. The purpose of the poster is to explain
the technology used, particularly highlight the four chosen features, as well
as to showcase the robots’ software and hardware. Posters should be made in
an interesting and engaging format, as they will be viewed not only by the
judges but also by other teams and visiting members of the public.

Teams must submit a digital copy of their poster in PDF format. 

The size of the poster should be no larger than A1 (60 x 84 cm).

Areas that are useful to be included in the poster are:
1. team name and region
2. abstract/summary
3. annotated pictures
4. system diagrams of the systems and robot(s) under development at various stages
5. an explanation of the innovative robot technologies used
6. a description of the features that should be judged during the performance
7. QR-codes to repositories, videos, or team websites

Teams participating on site will be given public space to display a Technical
Poster. [green-background]#Virtual teams may wish to send their poster with a
representative from their country to display at the venue.#

[[judging-and-feedback]]
== Judging and feedback

[[judging-criteria]]
=== Judging criteria

The judging criteria and allocation of marks are given in the respective
score sheets.

[[totaling]]
=== Totaling

The total score of each team is calculated by combining the scores from the
team’s Technical Interview, the Technical Demonstration, and the
OnStage Performances.

[[feedback]]
=== Feedback

RoboCupJunior is an educational project. It is important that team members
learn from their experiences with RCJ, so that they have the opportunity to
improve. 

Feedback and notifications of deductions will be given after the first
performance to allow teams to better prepare for the second performance.

A final ranking that includes all teams and their scoring will not be
provided to the teams. The teams will get their approximate ranking and
their individual scores for their interview, performance, technical
demonstration video and poster.

Feedback will not be accepted as evidence to debate positions, decisions,
or competition scores with the judges.

[[code-of-conduct]]
== Code of conduct

[[spirit]]
=== Spirit

It is expected that all participants, students, and mentors, will respect
the RoboCupJunior mission, values, and goals.

It is not whether you win or lose, but how much you learn that counts.
Choosing not to take this opportunity to collaborate with students and mentors
from all over the world means missing out on a lifelong learning experience.
Remember this is a unique moment!

[[fair-play]]
=== Fair play

It is expected that the aim of all teams is to participate in a fair and
clean competition.

Humans that may cause deliberate interference with robots, robots'
performance [blue-background]#and/or damage to the stage# will be subject to
disciplinary action. This will be decided by the OnStage League Committee
and RoboCupJunior Officials.

Remember, helping those in need and demonstrating friendship and cooperation
is the spirit of RoboCupJunior, as well as helping make the world a better
place.

Participants are encouraged to help each other.

[[behavior]]
=== Behavior

All behavior is to be of a subdued nature while at the competition. It is
expected that every participant behaves in a respectful manner towards each
other.

Participants are not to enter set-up areas of other leagues or other
teams unless expressly invited to do so by other team members. Participants
who misbehave may have disciplinary action taken against them.

[[robocupjunior-officials]]
=== RoboCupJunior Officials

The officials will act within the spirit of the event.

The RoboCupJunior officials shall not have a close relationship with any
of the teams in the league they judge.

[[mentors]]
=== Mentors

Each team is required to have a mentor to assist with the communication
among the team and facilitate their learning. The mentor receives
communications from the committee leading up to and during the competition
via the email address used for their registration.

Mentors (defined as teachers, parents, chaperones, translators, or any
other adult non-team members) are not allowed in the student work area
except to assist in carrying equipment in or out of the area on the
arrival and departure days.

If a problem is encountered that is beyond the team’s capabilities and
is clearly beyond the reasonable ability level of a student to repair,
mentors may request assistance from the OnStage League Committee, including
supervised support to conduct repairs.

Mentors are not allowed to set up equipment on stage, as this should be the
responsibility of team members. Teams should design all robots and any
additional equipment to be carried by team members only.

Disciplinary action will be taken should a mentor be found mending, building
and/or programming the robot(s), and/or directing choreography. Judges may
question the team’s originality if this occurs and teams may risk deductions
or disqualification.

[[additional-information]]
== Additional information

[[sharing]]
=== Sharing

It is understood that RCJ events with rich technological and curricular
developments should be shared with other participants.

Team materials may be published on the RoboCupJunior media platforms
during the event.

Sharing information furthers the mission of RoboCupJunior as an educational
initiative.

[[rule-clarification]]
=== Rule Clarification

If any rule clarification is needed, please contact the International
RoboCupJunior OnStage League Committee, using the Junior Forum
(https://junior.forum.robocup.org). Once the inquiry is posted on this
forum, OnStage League Committee members will respond as soon as possible.

If necessary, even during a competition, rule clarifications may be made
by members of the RoboCupJunior OnStage League Committee.
[[information-before-and-during-the-event]]

=== Information before and during the event
Teams will be responsible for checking for updated information during the
event. Methods of communication during the event will be announced to the
registered mentors via email before the competition.

Teams are strongly encouraged to check the RoboCupJunior Forum which conveys
information about the competition before the competition.
[[special-circumstances]]

=== Special Circumstances
If special circumstances occur, such as unforeseen problems or capabilities
of a robot, these rules may be modified by the RoboCupJunior OnStage League
Committee Chair in conjunction with available Committee members, if necessary,
even during competition.

If any of the team leaders/mentors are not present at the team meetings to
discuss the problems and the resulting rule modifications, they consent to the
rule modifications and are not permitted to challenge them at a later time.
